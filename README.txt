First things first:
I believe that all of the necessary files should be here so that the R Project works as intended when you download it. The important thing is that the folder of images from the archive needs to be in your R working directory. I think my Data Management Plan file contains the best overview of my project, my methodology, project goals, and why I made the decisions that I did. One of the central decisions of the project was to use Tropy, an open-source research photo management program, as the central hub where all of my data comes together. While it has some serious limitations, is so far the best piece of research photo management software I've found. Overall, the project had some unexpected twists and turns, I ended up becoming intimately familiar with Portuguese laws governing the reproduction and use of archival materials, and ended up having to completely change my final repository plans in order to avoid accidentally becoming an international criminal guilty of history crime! 


Basic overview of my R code, what it accomplishes and its weaknesses:
I’m sure this is some of the worst R code you’ve ever seen! But considering where I started at the beginning of the semester, I’m happy with the final product. The annotated R code should load the proper libraries, extract OCR text from the images, and create a csv file with the extracted text. There were two issues that in the end I wasn’t able to solve. The smaller issue was that I wasn’t able to get my automated data cleanup in R to remove all OCR errors. There are a few OCR artifacts that when I attempted to remove them from the text, my code ended up completely wrecking the data’s formatting. In the end, some cleanup in still required when moving the text data into Tropy. Which leads me to the major issue. Ideally my R code would run the OCR and import the extracted text data directly into the correct locations in Tropy, but I wasn’t able to accomplish this. Attempting to automate data extraction via RStudio code into Tropy exposed a number of Tropy’s shortcomings, namely, Tropy’s inflexible reliance on json as the basis of metadata construction and organization. Given the remarkable versatility of RStudio, I have no doubt that a more talented programmer than I would have no issues implementing greater automation via RStudio. However, the main obstacle that I encountered was the lack of an option to directly edit my Tropy metadata’s json code, without corrupting my Tropy data and having to re-associate all images, data, and organizational structures. Even if Tropy allowed users to directly edit their metadata’s json code within Tropy, there is no option to import a json file into Tropy, which presents another barrier to using RStudio to efficiently read, edit, and write metadata contained in a json file, which could then be imported into Tropy. This flaw, combined with Tropy’s overall lack of powerful features for metadata manipulation demonstrate that while open-source software is essential for adhering to the principles of effective, long-term data management, open-source software is not a panacea for software development. Tropy’s development was funded in part by federal humanities funding, which, with significant increases, presents what appears to be an excellent solution to some of the issues of open-source software development. 

Metadata information:
As mentioned in my Data Management Plan, my metadata is comprised of two parts: a Michner-style text file, and a json file exported from Tropy. I consider the way that all of my data came together in Tropy to be the best representation of my final "cleaned up" data set. In addiiton to a .json export, Tropy also offers an option to export all data from a project in a zipped format that is ideal for sharing my final product, but that export data would also include images of archival documents, and thus I'm hesitant to post that zip file on my GitHub. If you have issues with the json file or would prefer the zipped copy of the entire Tropy project, please let me know and I can send that to you directly. 

I'm still learning the ins and outs of GitHub. If someone would have told me last year that I would have an account with programming code that I wrote, I would have never believed it! But if any of the necessary files are missing or if there are any issues, please let me know. 

Thank you for a wonderful semester!
